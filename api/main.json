She navigates tea parties filled with ladies attempting to assert their dominance, attends an academy thick with ulterior motives, and dodges harassment flung at her with an icy glare and fierce counters, but it's that stone-cold heart of hers that leaves her isolated and alone.<br><br>One day, she learns her stepsister has become engaged to the second prince, a fact that forces her to run away from home. She doesn't get far before bumping into someone, however, and that someone just happens to be the first prince. Come watch as the cold-blooded former assassin who's never known love dives fearlessly into noble society!",

For some reason, she’s also taken on the responsibility of reprimanding the slacker who sits next to her in class. Masachika Kuze is constantly frustrating her by falling asleep, forgetting his textbooks, and just being an overall unexemplary student. Or at least, that’s how it looks from the outside. She may put on a tough act, but she doesn’t mind Masachika as much as others would think. She even lets him call her by her nickname, Alya. Anyone hearing the comments she mutters in Russian under her breath might know how she really feels, but since none of her classmates understand the language, she’s free to say whatever she likes! Except…there is one person who knows what she’s saying. Masachika eavesdrops on her embarrassing revelations, pretending to be clueless, all the while wondering what her flirtatious comments actually mean!",
